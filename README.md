Swump! refers to Sudoku With Unique Multi-Play. It aims to reinvent how Sudoku is played traditionally by delivering a Sudoku application with a unique twist: one that allows multiple players to play on the same board as they engage in a battle of strategy and luck!

The highlight of this product, multi-play, allows up to 4 players to play on a single Sudoku puzzle. The game is played in turns and each turn has a time limit. A player has a limited number of tries within a turn and the objective is to get as many cells correct as possible during a turn. To win the game, a player has to have the most number of filled cells. A good icebreaker or get together over the coffee table!

Multiplayer mode also features power-ups to make puzzle solving challenging and fun at the same time. Power-ups include taking over a player's filled cell, revealing a hint, a time extension, or an increase to the number of tries in each turn. A player has a chance to receive one of the power-ups each turn at random and can choose to use them during his turn or to store them (up to 3 power-ups can be stored). A player with the most number of cells filled correctly after a puzzle is solved wins the game.
